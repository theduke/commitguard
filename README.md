# commitguard

**commitguard** is a [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) library that makes it very easy to create
shell scripts that can be used as **git pre-commit** hooks.

The primary use case is generating pre-commit hooks for Rust projects automatically in a **build.rs** build script,
but it may be useful for other projects too.
